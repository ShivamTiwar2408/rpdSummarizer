                          <Sent id="1.1"> The current upper bound on RPD comment size is 5mb, which is way too large. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.2"> RPDs with this amount of content can barely be loaded (this is an example http://is.factset.com/rpd/summary.aspx?messageId=26560032 ). </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.3"> I'm recommending changing this limit to 500k bytes. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.4"> This accounts for 99.99% of RPDs filed in the last month. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.5"> Out of the 23 RPDs that would have failed to post, 40% of them are posted by a single service account, using RPDs to post log results as text (one example is the RPD I posted above). </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.6"> @RobertGroce @ChrisWerner please approve/discuss. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.7"> If anything I think we should discuss being more aggressive, 50k for example accounts for 99.85% of RPDs. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="3.4"> If these ALL see like logs/service posts then we can just limit to 50k and be done. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="3.5"> We should make all APIs return 400s and fail the request when this happens. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="3.6"> We can update docs to reflect that they should provide a URL/link to their document if they need more room. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="8.9"> As for human users, it's pretty easy to detect when the limit is hit, QAI does this and limits comments to 4000 chars. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="8.10"> In QAI, if a paste occurs that would push paste 4000 we prevent it and state to paste less, but I'm wondering for human users can we build an ER to detect the overly large paste and prompt "This paste is too large, would you like to attach it as a text file?". </Sent>
                          <Sent id="8.11"> We could ship the already capture paste text to fileStore as a text file fairly easily and that would make it easy for Users to still do things like this: http://is.factset.com/rpd/Summary.aspx?messageId=09-31670 </Sent>
