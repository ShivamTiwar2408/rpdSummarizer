                          <Sent id="4.2"> As per my testing, Identified couple of unexpected behaviours. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.3"> Below are the details. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.4"> 1) Name Change Date(Old Filed) is accepting Future Name Change Date. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.5"> Expected Behaviour: It should allow only today and Older dates(Note: not older than Launch Date) but not the Future date as Already separate Button added to portmas as part Enhancement. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.6"> Please find the below screeshot for better understanding. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.7"> 2) Future Termination Date: Expected Behaviour: It should not allow for Termination for future date if the Researcher choosen Liquidation option as Permanent or Temporary as already we have separate option for future Termination "Future". </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.8"> Below screenshots for better understand. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.9"> Current behaviour: Able to terminate the fund for Future date by choosing Liquidation as Permanant &amp; Temporary. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.10"> Temporary Termination - Future Date Permanent Termination - Future Date Note: If the Researcher by mistake chosen permanent with Future Date, Its terminating immedately instaed of Future Date. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.11"> Because of this It won't reflect in product from the date of termination action done instead of Future date. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="4.12"> Requesting to fix those two unexpected behaviours too! </Sent>

                          <Sent id="5.1"> Hello @PoojaSreekanthKaradgi , I have tested in FDS App V2 - Staging for the Name change date and Termination dates issue. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.2"> I have tested the below scenarios and all are working as expected. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.3"> Name Change Dates: 1) For Name changes it is not accepting the dates older than Launch date and giving an error message - Fixed 2) For funds without Launch date it is taking 01/01/1960 as default and it is accepting name change dates from 01/01/1960 - Fixed 3) For Future Name changes it is not accepting the dates older than today's date - Fixed Termination Dates: For Termination dates portmas is considering Launch date and DLR as criteria. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.4"> 1) Portmas is not allowing us to terminate the fund with date before launch date - Fixed 2) If the Fund is having DLR the tool will accept termination date after the DLR date - Fixed 3) For future terminations the tool is not accepting report date older than today's date. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.5"> - Fixed Please find the attached testing document for your reference. </Sent>
