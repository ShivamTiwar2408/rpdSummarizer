                          <Sent id="1.2"> for example: Chrome FPE only has 51 Chrome SGE has up to 54 Current client usage shows we should be testing on 56 http://fds-web-stats.factset.io/dashboard/browser-stats?startDate=Sun%20Feb%2019%202017%2010:48:50%20GMT-0500&amp;endDate=Tue%20Mar%2021%202017%2010:48:50%20GMT-0400&amp;source=external&amp;uniqueUsers=unique&amp;showMinor=false&amp;application=all </Sent>

                          <Sent id="3.1"> @LilunCao @AngelaYacovelli It may not be trivial to have all the browser versions available on JEP because of the limitations we have. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="3.2"> unlike in SGE we can host only one browser per a VM. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="3.3"> They can be installed on the fly [ RPD:27069245 ] Saw a link online which may help but we need to look into further to evaluate the suggestions http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10541225/cross-browser-testing-all-major-browsers-on-one-machine#10541484 do some os level sanboxing NOTE: The implication of the above propsals on VM diskspace increases in the same order as listed Also, there is a dependency on drivers(used by scripts to launch a browser instance), the project archives should be forced to have multiple drivers or tellus has to provide the approprite one. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="3.4"> @LilunCao please holdoff on updating the browser version file for FPE Thanks, Krishna </Sent>
