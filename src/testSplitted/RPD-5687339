                          <Sent id="24.3"> Currently we don't remove the failing server from the pool, so subsequent requests will go through the same process if we are in a "zombie" state on the server-side. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="24.4"> We expect that a failing server will either die or be killed by monit (due to memory use or cpu use). </Sent>

                          <Sent id="25.1"> @DemetryZilberg , @GregJordan , @SeanBattis and I just met regarding our failure scenarios and site failover. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.2"> The primary concern is that shadow mode can cause a long delay if there is a failure on the server side. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.3"> The client itself has retries, redundancy and failover but those actually help to cause this problem. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.4"> We want shadow mode to have no impact to the end user even if it is facing a major failure. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.5"> Toward this end I'll be doing the following: Lower the Session retry timeout when shadow mode is enabled. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.6"> Remove pool members that have reported errors from a client's connection pool for some period of time. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.7"> Test a few failure modes from the client side: Auds server hanging when a tcp/ip connection is established. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.8"> No auds servers available. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.9"> Auds servers advertised but non-responsive. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.10"> Migrate our monitoring/dashboard to audsadma01 when it's been rebuilt by unix team. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="25.12"> This is expected to take a couple of weeks and is seen as a prerequisite for client shadow mode testing. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.13"> Greg will re-enable shadow mode on fdsc. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="25.14"> Once the failure mode testing is complete we will be resuming fdsa devel/inhouse testing. </Sent>
