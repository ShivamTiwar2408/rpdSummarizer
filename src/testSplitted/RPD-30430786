                          <Sent id="1.1"> The purpose of this is to enhance Tellus API and test launcher to have a way to schedule jobs but that they will never run, pull VMs or affect load of Tellus. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.2"> As a way to test the scheduler itself. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.3"> @KenMorris and I discussed possibly allowing for a Priority of 0 to be passed to the API or maybe a new ScheduleType ("none"), but a new Property (like Fake: true or ScheduleOnly: true) would be fine too. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.4"> QAI would use this to hit Tellus API with a full Online SWP worth of Test Case jobs, all as 'RunNow' and see how the scheduler responds and where items get scheduled, but prevent Tellus framework from having to launch and actually run these tests. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="2.2"> Right now we have priorities 1,2,3,4. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.3"> 1 is the highest and any jobs with priority 1 will be running first at the specified time. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.4"> Online jobs have priority 1. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.5"> If we want to run online jobs before any other jobs, we can set their priorities to 0. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.6"> Then we push other jobs back given the limited number of VMs. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.7"> In the scheduler, I may be able to save those jobs in a file and remove them from the response. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.8"> That way they will not run. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.9"> But most of other jobs will be pushed back since there may be lots of jobs with priority 0. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.10"> Any idea? </Sent>

                          <Sent id="7.3"> The fact is that we want to test the scheduler on tellusdev, so having items schedule 'extra low' no matter what doesn't properly let us test the scheduler. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="11.1"> @LilunCao This sounds fine to me, but if it doesn't end up cronned, how can we know the result of the scheduling? </Sent>
                          <Sent id="11.2"> It will still exist as a groupId or instanceId that we can verify using the API? </Sent>
                          <Sent id="11.3"> Otherwise, should we just create a completely seperate end-point for this that could return the result of the scheduling? </Sent>
                          <Sent id="11.4"> Ie. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="11.5"> after sending these requests, that is 1100 Cases worth of jobs, chunked by Environment and Product, so maybe 100 requests, we would want to verify the scheduled start date and priority values supplied to each job. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="11.6"> So QAI can either query a 2nd time each job or maybe we have an end-point that returns this? </Sent>
                          <Sent id="11.7"> If an end-point we could keep it on tellusdev only. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="13.1"> Hi @KenMorris @ChrisWerner Some php modules may need to be modified since only the following fields will be sent to the scheduler: { "task" : [{ "start" : "2017-04-06T03:53:38", "end" : "2017-04-06T04:02:38", "priority" : 4, "testenvironment" : "FPE", "sgbrowsername" : null, "sgbrowserversion" : null, "groupid" : 342763, "eventid" : 161527 } ] } It is easier to set priority to 5 in tellusapi if scheduletype is set to "none". </Sent>
