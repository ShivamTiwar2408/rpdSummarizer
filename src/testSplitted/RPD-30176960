                          <Sent id="1.1"> Hi @LilunCao A few test cases are failing as the resolution of the Selenium grid nodes is less. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.2"> So far Focal Point VM's resolution is working fine for all the applications I've automated. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.3"> So it would be better to have the same resolution on the Selenium grid node machines. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.4"> Please increase the resolution of the selenium grid machines and let me know if you need any other information. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="2.1"> Hi @ShivaKumariMandala I did some testing and found that if the script was running against the node on Windows Server 2008 for dev, the max resolution that could be reached there was 1928x1088 by default in case the following statement was used in the script: wd.driver.manage.window.maximize But if the script was running against the node on Windows Server 2012 for dev, the max resolution that could be reached was 1040x784 by default. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.2"> Also we don't have any node configuration option to set any default resolution on any node. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.3"> We can only set the physical display resolution to 1920x1200. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.4"> So I am going to do some research to see whether we can improve the browser resolution for the nodes on Windows Server 2012. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.5"> Right now we have two node machines for dev and prod respectively: one node machine on Windows Server 2008 and another one on Windows Server 2012. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="2.6"> The hub uses some algorithms to redirect the requests to the nodes on 2008 and 2012, so the scripts may be running with different browser resolutions each time. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="3.1"> Hi @ShivaKumariMandala If we ran the node on the command line on tellusgridb05 (Windows Server 2012) instead of a windows service, then the larger browser resolution 1936x1176 for chrome could be reached. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="3.2"> Seems running the nodes as windows services causes some limitation to the browsers on Windows Server 2012. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="3.3"> Hopefully we can find a way to reach the wanted browser resolution by launching the nodes as windows services (browsers run in the background); Otherwise we have to run the nodes on the command line, but this will cause the browsers to run in the foreground. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="3.4"> It may not be a good solution. </Sent>
