                          <Sent id="69.3"> This will go out to "Portfolio Analysis Announcements" tonight, and will be available to all PA users in Quick View or in the Notify application. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="69.4"> ******************** Subject: Change to the Behavior of Holdings as of "End of Period" and -Client Portfolio- Pricing On 26-Jul-2012, a change will be made that affects how pricing information is retrieved in Portfolio Analysis reports which use Buy   Hold mode with holdings as of "End of Period" and the "Client Portfolio" pricing source. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="69.5"> Currently, when you use Buy   Hold mode with "End of Period" holdings and "Client Portfolio" pricing, prices are retrieved from the same day as shares as well as the day after. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="69.6"> For example, if you run a report from January 11 - January 12, shares are used from January 12 and prices are used from January 12 and January 13. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="69.8"> For example, if you run a report from January 11 - January 12, the prices used will be from January 11 and January 12. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="69.9"> This change is being made so that the behavior of price retrieval within reports which use Buy   Hold mode with "End of Period" holdings and "Client Portfolio" pricing is consistent with the behavior of price retrieval when using any other Portfolio Analysis pricing source(s). </Sent>
                          <Sent id="69.10"> If you have questions about this change or would like to know which of your saved reports are affected, contact your PMW specialist or email pmw_support@factset.com. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="72.2"> We took Mark's final doc scan from the 27th, removed duplicates (1455 records remain), then used list builder to download the entire universe of IDs in fdsCRM and ran a VLOOKUP on the Serial Numbers to bring in the fdsCRM ID. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="72.3"> Once we got the fdsCRM ID, we used Client Central formulas to bring in the user's name, phone number, PA Specialist, consultant (the consultant field in the original file was way out of date). </Sent>
                          <Sent id="72.4"> There are likely cancelled serial numbers in this list too, but the consultant and PA Specialist will just have to use what they know about the accounts to realize whether or not they need to contact any particular user. </Sent>
