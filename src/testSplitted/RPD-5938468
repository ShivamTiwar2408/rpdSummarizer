                          <Sent id="1.1"> In addition to the recent Morph grant_access integration changes, it would be useful if super client access could be granted at the same time. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.2"> Although it is possible to link super client access to be granted automatically, I think it might be better to prompt the user. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.3"> We can set "yes" as the default response so that you just have to hit enter, but this way inhouse users are aware/mindful of their additional secure access request. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.4"> @PrasannaVenkatesh -- will this work nicely with the current secure user log infrastructure on your end? </Sent>

                          <Sent id="2.1"> I like the idea of prompting explicitly for superclient access vs granting it to them by default, in a majority of the cases from the secure client logs, people do not request access to superclient when requesting access to a specific client simply because that client happens to be a member of a superclient. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="7.2"> My comments were made based on the usage of secure client access and I was suggesting one additional question about superclient rather than blindly giving it to them. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="7.3"> If someone does not know what superclient is, they should probably not be accessing it. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="7.4"> In NJ, for the last 3 years, there were 109,625 access requests out of which 1327 were for super clients (about 1%) In VA, for the last 3 years, there were 94980 access requests out of which 2570 were for super clients (about 3%) Also, I'm all for reducing clutter, so, if there are more suggestions about the alleged cluttered process especially as it pertains to requesting secure client access, I'm all ears. </Sent>
