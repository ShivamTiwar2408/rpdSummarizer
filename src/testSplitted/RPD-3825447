                          <Sent id="1.1"> Hi all, Submitting this request as I think it is something that could be very useful. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.2"> Most of us know it is often a challenge/time consuming to find the solution to an RPD, even if it exists, because of the often very long list of comments tied to certain RPD's. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.3"> The solution is often not even at the end of the RPD as users add on for clarifiying/secondary questions. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.4"> I think it would be extraordinarily useful to add the ability to flag/mark the relevant comments in an RPD. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.5"> I thought of a few ways this could be done. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.6"> 1) Add a "Flag as Solution" button, which could highlight the selected comment in green for example, so it is easy to see scrolling down the list. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.7"> 2) Add filter options for comments, so you filter to see only comments made by the product team/assignee. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.8"> Not very useful though if it is a very long RPD. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.9"> 3) Add a box on the bottom for "solution" where the assignee aggregates all the important comments/answers in a designated area which can be found easily. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.10"> Does this sound like an enhancement that could be implemented, or has been inquired about before? </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.11"> This could be a key benefit to all employees for helping them utilize their time better. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.12"> On helpdesk calls for instance, you might find the relevant RPD within seconds, but it often takes a few minutes to search through all the comments to find the one specific one you need. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.13"> Thanks! </Sent>
                          <Sent id="1.14"> Brandon </Sent>

                          <Sent id="5.1"> I would strongly support this suggestion from the PD side, and take it one step further by also summarizing the problem. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.2"> I was thinking it would be useful to have a section in the RPD called "synopsis", where the product expert could concisely summarize the problem and the solution. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.3"> This would have the following benefits: - Save other users time when searching for a similar problem -- as Brandon states, they wouldn't have to read through dozens of comments to figure out if the problem matches their's and they would be able to easily find the solution to the problem. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.4"> - If the problem only relates to a specific FactSet version, Office version, etc., that can be stated in the synopsis. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.5"> - The synopsis would be written by the product expert, and use terms that RPD filers would typically search on, so the RPD will be more likely to be returned in search results. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.6"> - Help eliminate duplicate RPDs (and save PD from addressing those duplicate RPDs). </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.7"> - RPD filers often paste in error messages. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.8"> Since images cannot be searched, the relevant RPDs often are not returned in search results. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.9"> The synoposis would contain the error text so that it would be returned in search results. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="5.10"> This would end up benefiting both those that file RPDs and those that respond to RPDs. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="8.2"> My suggestion above is to include both a synopsis and a solution for a given RPD. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="8.3"> This could be optional, but would be really helpful for the reasons I mentioned above. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="8.4"> If it were exposed in search (perhaps hovering over a search result would show a tooltip with the synopsis) it would really help RPD users find relevant RPDs and quick solutions to their issues (without having to read through lots of RPD text/comments). </Sent>

                          <Sent id="14.2"> Example of how the existing functionality can help: if one knows the RPD product, you can sift a single RPD out of the masses produced by a query with no keywords, using that filter by panel: If one had another useful piece of data related to what one wanted to find (eg a keyword, or a person's name) then you can find SOlution tagged RPDs this way. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="15.2"> Searching for tags will also be very helpful. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.3"> @LucyTancredi - The comment tagged with #solution would likely just be the solution to the RPD, and not describe the problem. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.4"> Simply tagging one comment with "solution" will help in some cases, but won't be enough in the following cases: - In many cases, a solution is spread over multiple comments (e.g. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.5"> an engineer/PD suggests trying A to solve the issue, then the user replies saying that partially helped, so they suggest trying B, etc.) -- one concise comment eloquently stating the solution or troubleshooting tips, along with other relevant info (e.g. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.6"> FDS minimum version requirement, or CACCESS restrictions, or anything else) would be more helpful. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.7"> - Sometimes it's hard to discern whether the problem in the RPD is the same issue that you're having. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.8"> The filer might think the issue is X, when really after troubleshooting, we discover it is Y. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.9"> The synposis would state the problem in a way that makes it relevant for everyone (not just a specific template for example). </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.10"> - A single RPD could have solutions to multiple issues, and the initial problem description might not cover all of the issues discussed in the RPD. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.11"> I think its nice to be able to read a concise problem description and solution -- as opposed to having to scan through an RPD to find the problem, and then separately reading the solution. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.12"> As I said above, if this could be exposed through the hover in search results, it would likely save users a lot of time. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="15.13"> For example, in this RPD:4138325 , the comment tagged "solution" doesn't explain what the problem is. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="16.1"> Hi All, Thanks for the discussion on this. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="16.2"> Michelle in her last comment highlights my initial thoughts behind this. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="16.3"> In a large portion of helpdesk calls, if it is necessary to search within RPD's, many times I'll find the exact RPD I need within seconds, but it may take me another 5-10 minutes just to try and sift through all the comments and try out different workarounds/solutions for the initial problem. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="16.4"> I think adding a comment that can be flagged (preferably color-coded so it can be seen in a long list), and contain a solution will drastically improve client service time. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="16.5"> I also think it is a great idea to include a synopsis, because it is a very common occurence that the initial RPD creator describes a situation which is irrelavant to the actual issue at hand, mostly because of misinterpretations/assumptions. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="16.6"> Having an easy to find synopsis and solution could essentially eliminate the need for the intermittent comments once an RPD is closed. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="16.7"> The conversation is very important during the solution-finding phase, but afterwards, RPD's are more essential as a database of answers, so adding this could "limit the bulk," and help all departments find what they need more efficiently/accurately. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="16.8"> Thanks, Brandon </Sent>

                          <Sent id="17.1"> Thanks Michelle and Brandon for the detailed explanation - that clarifies for me. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.2"> What I missed is that you're looking for a Problem Synopsis, not (or rather, in addition to) a concise Solution. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.3"> My next thoughts/questions then are 1) Why aren't assignees / product owners providing concise, eloquent solutions / synopses now when they Resolve requests, and how to motivate them to do so with an enhancement to the RPD system. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.4"> I suspect many are engaged with the current RPD back-and-forth and not seeing it in the bigger picture of people searching for it in the future and needing a quick way to glean its important information. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.5"> So I would think some prompt like "Please include a concise problem synopsis and solution for future readers / searchers. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.6"> This should include any troubleshooting tips, minimum version requirements, CACCESS restrictions, or other relevant info." would help. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.7"> We could add this to the current Resolution box prompt, but as Brandon said the solution is sometimes not at the end. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.8"> Which brings up 2) How to encourage people to flag something as a solution/synopsis, and so the RPD system knows what to prompt when. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.9"> Perhaps adding some standard/suggested tags (that people could click to add) below the existing "Search Tags' box in the Add Comment section would solve that. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.10"> We could then allow filtering on these in a future iteration. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.11"> (I.e. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.12"> show me all the status updates / latest status update, all the questions, etc in this RPD). </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.13"> We could also flag questions as answered/unanswered, build views on that, etc. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="17.14"> Do you think that would address this issue, or are you looking for something different? </Sent>

                          <Sent id="18.1"> @LucyTancredi - I think re-branding the RPD resolution comment is a great idea. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="18.2"> As a PD who very much wants to solve the issues we've discussed above, I can say that PDs generally do not think of the resolution comment as a place to provide a problem/solution synopsis (most of us just say "resolved" or "resolving per comments above") -- but it's a great place to do exactly that. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="18.3"> Ideally we'd make adding concise problem and solutions synopses to RPDs a best practice at FactSet. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="18.4"> We could add text that says something like "Please provide a concise description of both the problem and the solution so that other RPD filers can easily find this important information. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="18.5"> You might choose to include relevant FDSW versions, error message text, troubleshooting tips, etc." The one concern that comes to mind is that RPDs that have the "Atlas Release" field filled in (e.g. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="18.6"> 2011.4A) will get automatically resolved by a script when that FDSW version is released. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="18.7"> That script is really helpful, but it will mean that the RPD filer or PD will have to go back and proactively add synopses to relevant RPDs (question: is the resolution comment editable?). </Sent>

                          <Sent id="24.1"> Adding to this @BryanEhrlich comment from here: http://is.factset.com/rpd/summary.aspx?messageId=23001442&amp;commentId=23004631 I think the solution of just having some 'standard' tags that will show at the top of the RPD and jump to the comment with that tag is a good solution to this. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="24.2"> We would probably allow this 'Workaround' tag only on comments and allow only one per RPD ? </Sent>
                          <Sent id="24.3"> We could have other tags like 'Summary'/'Retrospect'/'Synopsis', or whatever other type tags or comments are relevant to the S&amp;C workflow. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="24.4"> If this becomes a standard workflow, we could also probably define a 'validity', that is, bug or incident from a client that required certain input or some other criteria and allow views built where the synopsis is not yet provided. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="24.5"> Or make it required to provide before resolution? </Sent>
                          <Sent id="24.6"> @BrandonNovack @RachelBattis Let me know your thoughts or I can reach out to S&amp;C at large to get additional input. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="25.3"> Being able to tag just one comment as the workaround seems appropriate. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="26.10"> 'Problem synopsis' - I'm not sure how often this is really an issue or if getting the actual error message is enough. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="26.14"> I think the resolution comment should ideally be the solution synopsis, so it's just a matter of encouraging or forcing this. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="26.15"> I think we could also support resolving using an existing comment, often the resolution ends up as just trying to change the Status when a comment already summarizes the fix, this could work like 'edit comment' and bring in the existing comment for editing but actually file a new comment when resolving. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="26.16"> I think 2 and 3 combined with cleaning up the summary interface to hide the majority of comments by default would really help the majority of RPDs: http://is.factset.com/rpd/summary.aspx?messageId=1649080&amp;commentId=19264337 Example RPD http://is.factset.com/RPD/summary.aspx?messageid=4138325 4. </Sent>

                          <Sent id="32.16"> Or if there are standard 'categories' of these upvotes (say, 'workaround', 'eta', solution'), then these could be chosen and tagged directly to the comment, even as regular 'tags' now. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="32.17"> We could just put a bit more structure around it. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="32.18"> This would also help with the 100+ comment large RPDs that are very slow to open. </Sent>
                          <Sent id="32.19"> I think this is something we should/will consider in the UI simplification. </Sent>
